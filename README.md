# What is DevSecOps 
DevSecOps focuses on security automation, testing and enforcement during DevOps - Release - SDLC cycles. The whole meaning behind this methodology is connecting together Development, Security and Operations. DevSecOps is methodology providing different methods, techniques and processes backed mainly with tooling focusing on developer / security experience. 

DevSecOps takes care that security is part of every stage of DevOps loop - Plan, Code, Build, Test, Release, Deploy, Operate, Monitor.

# Tooling

## Pre-commit time tools

In this section you can find lifecycle helpers, pre-commit hook tools and threat modeling tools. Threat modeling tools are specific category by themselves allowing you to simulate and discover potential gaps before you start to develop the software or during the process.

Modern DevSecOps tools allow using Threat modeling as code or generation of threat models based on the existing code annotations.

## Secrets management 
Secrets management includes managing, versioning, encryption, discovery, rotating, provisioning of passwords, certificates, configuration values and other types of secrets.

## OSS and Dependency management

Dependency security testing and analysis is very important part of discovering supply chain attacks. SBOM creation and following dependency scanning (Software composition analysis) is critical part of continuous integration (CI). Data series and data trends tracking should be part of CI tooling. You need to know what you produce and what you consume in context of libraries and packages.

## Supply chain specific tools 

Supply chain is often the target of attacks. Which libraries you use can have a massive impact on security of the final product (artifacts). CI (continuous integration) must be monitored inside the tasks and jobs in pipeline steps. Integrity checks must be stored out of the system and in ideal case several validation runs with comparison of integrity hashes / or attestation must be performed.

## SAST

Static code review tools working with source code and looking for known patterns and relationships of methods, variables, classes and libraries. SAST works with the raw code and usually not with build packages.

## DAST

Dynamic application security testing (DAST) is a type of application testing (in most cases web) that checks your application from the outside by active communication and analysis of the responses based on injected inputs. DAST tools rely on inputs and outputs to operate. A DAST tool uses these to check for security problems while the software is actually running and is actively deployed on the server (or serverless function).
